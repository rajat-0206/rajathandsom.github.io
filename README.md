# Guidelines
For those who are new to github, must checkout how github works and should go through tutorials on github before initiating anything. I would recommend collaborators to have 'Github for desktop' application installed in their PCs, for convinience in commiting and pushing the changes they make after cloning it on their PCs. Also the code editor that author uses is Visual Studio Code (VScode by Microsoft), but you may use editors of your own choice.


Good luck!
